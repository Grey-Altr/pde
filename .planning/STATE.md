# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Any user can go from idea to shipped product through a single platform that handles the full development lifecycle.
**Current focus:** v0.22 Stakeholder Presentations — Phase 176: Data Extraction IR Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 176 of 184 (Data Extraction IR Foundation)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-29 — Roadmap created for v0.22 Stakeholder Presentations (9 phases, 58 requirements)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Prior milestone reference:**

- v0.21: 5 phases, 12 plans, ~20 requirements (1 day)
- v0.20: 8 phases, 23 plans, 41 requirements (1 day)
- v0.19: 7 phases, 16 plans, 30 requirements (1 day)
- v0.18: 13 phases, 28 plans, 54 requirements (2 days)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Roadmap]: Extraction-first architecture — LLM never reads .planning/ files directly; all quantitative claims extracted by deterministic code before any LLM call (prevents 28–39% hallucination rate per Stanford Legal RAG 2025)
- [Roadmap]: Two reference personas (CLU-01 executive summary + CLR-01 case study) built end-to-end independently in Phase 178 before any shared abstractions are extracted — proven duplication only
- [Roadmap]: CMD-01/CMD-02 split into Phase 177 (command shell) separate from Phase 176 (IR extraction) so extraction is testable standalone before command routing is wired
- [Roadmap]: SVG charts (Phase 179) run in parallel dependency with reference personas (Phase 178) — both depend on Phase 176 IR, neither depends on the other
- [Roadmap]: Auto-generation (Phase 183) after ALL personas are proven (Phase 181+182) — hook trigger depends on stable generation, not vice versa
- [Roadmap]: Portfolio synthesis (Phase 184) last — schema version heterogeneity across v0.12–v0.21 is highest-complexity risk; isolated after single-project synthesis is stable

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 176]: IR field completeness validation needed before finalizing schema — map each persona's data requirements to confirm all fields are deterministically extractable from current .planning/ artifacts
- [Phase 184]: Schema version inventory for portfolio synthesis — exact frontmatter key changes across PDE milestones v0.12–v0.21 need targeted audit before planning
